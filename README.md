    The Inventory Managemant System is a comprehensive software system built around four core entities: Product, Customer, Order and Supplier.

    Each product has a unique ID, name, price, description, production date, expiration date and quantity.

    Each customer has a unique ID, name, email, address and phone number.

    Each order has a unique ID, date, total cost and status (processing or shipping).

    Each supplier has a unique ID, name, address, email and phone number.

    The relationships between these entities are critical to the functioning of the system. Each product can be included in multiple orders, and each product is supplied by a single supplier. Each customer can submit multiple orders, and each order is placed by one customer. Each order can contain multiple products, and each supplier can supply multiple products.
